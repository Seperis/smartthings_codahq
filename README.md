I got super tired of waiting for August to implement the "SmartSense" (contact sensor) functionality.  No communication whatsoever.  Also, I think it's pretty silly that the only handler available that implements the contact sensor funtionality of the August Z-Wave lock is behind a pay-wall.

One hour later...  this thing.
